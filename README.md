## Introduction

This repository provides a minimal working example demonstrating how to empirically calculate the observability level of individual states for a nonlinear (partially observable) system, and accounts for sensor noise.

## Installing

The package can be installed by cloning the repo and running python setup.py install from inside the home pybounds directory.

Alternatively using pip
```bash
pip install pybounds
```


## Notebook examples
There is currently one simple example notebook. More to come.
*  Monocular camera with optic fow measurements: [mono_camera_example.ipynb](examples%2Fmono_camera_example.ipynb)
